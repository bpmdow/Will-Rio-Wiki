        <p>Here are the lyrics to "I Know Her Name":</p>
        <pre>
        [Verse 1]
        She’s got the fire, the grace, the name that rings  
        A voice that cuts through the noise of kings  
        Stands with a strength that holds me near  
        I know her name, it’s all I hear  

        [Chorus]  
        Kamala, Kamala, she’s in my mind  
        Stronger than steel, yet so refined  
        In a world apart, she’s close to me  
        I know her name, it sets me free  

        [Verse 2]  
        A leader of heart, a queen of the day  
        I see her rise and I know I’ll stay  
        A woman of power, but I see her so real  
        I know her name, and it’s how I feel  

        [Chorus]  
        Kamala, Kamala, she’s in my mind  
        Stronger than steel, yet so refined  
        In a world apart, she’s close to me  
        I know her name, it sets me free  

        [Bridge]  
        If I could stand by her side, I’d see  
        A world of hope and possibility  
        Her name alone brings strength to my heart  
        I know her name, and we’re never apart  

        [Chorus]  
        Kamala, Kamala, she’s in my mind  
        Stronger than steel, yet so refined  
        In a world apart, she’s close to me  
        I know her name, it sets me free
