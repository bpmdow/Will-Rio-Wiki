        <h1>Sick to My Stomach</h1>
        <p><b>"Sick to My Stomach"</b> is a raw, relatable track by Canadian indie pop artist <a href="mainpage.html">Will Rio</a> from his second studio album, <i>Sit Down</i>, released on November 8, 2024. This song takes a detour from Rio's usual themes of love and introspection, diving straight into the gritty aftermath of a wild night out. Inspired by the worst hangover of his life after an epic night in Kingston, "Sick to My Stomach" captures the pain, regret, and foggy memories that followed.</p>

        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
        <p>The song unfolds like a hazy memory, with Rio piecing together flashes of the night—a blur of neon lights, questionable shots, and regretful decisions. Known for his honest, down-to-earth storytelling, Rio doesn’t shy away from the grim details of hangover reality, mixing humor with hints of despair. "Sick to My Stomach" perfectly encapsulates the dual feelings of euphoria and regret that come with a rough night, capturing the universal pain of the morning after. It's a song that brings listeners into the depths of a party-induced spiral, offering an authentic, relatable take on the experience.</p>

        <h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>
        <p>Set to a mellow, slow beat that mimics the sluggish pace of a hungover morning, Rio’s lyrics take listeners through each stage of his misery—from pounding headaches to an uneasy stomach. The track’s tone is both self-deprecating and reflective, with Rio confessing to every poor decision that led him to this point. Musically, "Sick to My Stomach" uses sparse instrumentation to allow the rawness of Rio’s vocal performance to shine through, making each line feel as heavy as the weight of the hangover he describes. The use of a soft, throbbing bassline complements the feeling of physical discomfort, drawing listeners into the atmosphere of the track.</p>

        <p>Here are the lyrics to "Sick to My Stomach":</p>
        <pre>
        [Verse 1]
        Shots lined up, neon glow  
        ‘Just one more’—little did I know  
        Now I’m curled up, head’s in pain  
        Swearin’ I’ll never drink again  

        [Chorus]  
        Sick to my stomach, drowning in regret  
        Memories fade, but not done yet  
        I paid the price, and it hit me hard  
        One night out, left my soul scarred  

        [Verse 2]  
        Stumble home, can’t find my keys  
        Cursing my friends and their drinking pleas  
        Morning hits and I’m all alone  
        Can't believe I’m still in my clothes  

        [Chorus]  
        Sick to my stomach, drowning in regret  
        Memories fade, but not done yet  
        I paid the price, and it hit me hard  
        One night out, left my soul scarred  

        [Bridge]  
        I swear this pain will be the last  
        I’ll never fall for it, never again fast  
        But here I am, the cycle's the same  
        Sick to my stomach, feelin’ the shame  

        [Chorus]  
        Sick to my stomach, drowning in regret  
        Memories fade, but not done yet  
        I paid the price, and it hit me hard  
        One night out, left my soul scarred
