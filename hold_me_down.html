        <p>Here are the lyrics to "Hold Me Down":</p>
        <pre>
    <p><strong>Verse 1:</strong><br>
        You pulled me close, tied me tight,  <br>
        Hands on my chest, the room feels right. <br> 
        Every breath, every pull, every push,  <br>
        I let go, you're in control, feel the rush. <br>

        <p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>
        Hold me down honey, don't let go,  <br>
        Inside me now, let the tension flow.  <br>
        You’re in me, and I'm in you,  <br>
        Giving trust, we make it through. <br>

        <p><strong>Verse 2:</strong><br>
        Your hands on my skin, I can’t escape,  <br>
        The harder you hold, the more I shape.  <br>
        A dance of control, of give and take,  <br>
        Bound together, no mistake. <br>

        <p><strong>Bridge:</strong><br>
        Inside me now, deeper still,  <br>
        Every inch, every thrill.  <br>
        Push and pull, pleasure and pain,  <br>
        Hold me down, make it rain. <br>

        <p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>
        Hold me down honey, don’t let go,  <br>
        Inside me now, let the tension flow.  <br>
        You’re in me, and I'm in you,  <br>
        Giving trust, we make it through. <br>
        </pre>
