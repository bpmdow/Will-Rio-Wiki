        <p>Here are the lyrics to "Hold Me Down":</p>
        <pre>
        [Verse 1]
        You pulled me close, tied me tight,  
        Hands on my chest, the room feels right.  
        Every breath, every pull, every push,  
        I let go, you're in control, feel the rush.

        [Chorus]
        Hold me down, don't let go,  
        Inside me now, let the tension flow.  
        You’re in me, and I'm in you,  
        Giving trust, we make it through.

        [Verse 2]  
        Your hands on my skin, I can’t escape,  
        The harder you hold, the more I shape.  
        A dance of control, of give and take,  
        Bound together, no mistake.

        [Bridge]  
        Inside me now, deeper still,  
        Every inch, every thrill.  
        Push and pull, pleasure and pain,  
        Hold me down, make it rain.

        [Chorus]  
        Hold me down, don’t let go,  
        Inside me now, let the tension flow.  
        You’re in me, and I'm in you,  
        Giving trust, we make it through.
