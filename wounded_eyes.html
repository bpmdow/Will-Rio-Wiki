        <h1>Wounded Eyes</h1>
        <p><b>"Wounded Eyes"</b> is a track from Will Rio's second studio album, <i>Sit Down</i>, released on November 8, 2024. In this intriguing and somewhat comical song, Rio reflects on a chance encounter with unexpected explicit content. The song recounts his accidental viewing of trans pornography, a moment that sparks a blend of confusion, curiosity, and self-reflection.

        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
        <p>"Wounded Eyes" is a playful exploration of the unexpected places curiosity can lead. Rio narrates how he stumbled upon trans porn while aimlessly browsing the internet, finding himself taken aback yet intrigued by the unexpected discovery. The track is not just about the moment of surprise; it’s about the curiosity that follows—how a single click can provoke a flood of questions about identity, sexuality, and the nature of attraction. Rio muses on how our desires can sometimes take us into uncharted territories, challenging the boundaries of what we thought we knew about ourselves. The song’s light tone contrasts with the depth of self-exploration Rio embarks on as he processes this new experience.</p>

        <h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>
        <p>Musically, "Wounded Eyes" features a bouncy, upbeat melody with quirky synths and catchy rhythms that juxtapose the song’s theme of curiosity and self-exploration. Rio's delivery is light, almost playful, yet tinged with introspection as he grapples with the strange and unexpected situation. The song captures the humor and awkwardness of stumbling upon something unfamiliar, but also the vulnerability that comes with exploring these new and complex aspects of attraction. The upbeat tempo and quirky instrumentation add to the track's sense of fun, while Rio’s voice grounds it in a more thoughtful reflection on the nature of curiosity and personal growth.</p>

        <p>Here are the lyrics to "Wounded Eyes":</p>
        <pre>
        [Verse 1]  
        Clicked a link, not sure what I’d see,  
        Thought it was harmless, just some mystery.  
        But then I blinked and my eyes went wide,  
        Curious, confused, I couldn't hide.  

        [Chorus]  
        Wounded eyes, what did I find?  
        A world unknown, twisting my mind.  
        Curiosity, a dangerous game,  
        A click away from something I can't name.  

        [Verse 2]  
        Scrolling fast, don’t know where to go,  
        Stumbled on something I didn’t know.  
        Wondered why my heart skipped a beat,  
        Something inside me, incomplete.  

        [Chorus]  
        Wounded eyes, what did I find?  
        A world unknown, twisting my mind.  
        Curiosity, a dangerous game,  
        A click away from something I can't name.  

        [Bridge]  
        Questioning what I thought was true,  
        Who am I, what do I want to do?  
        An open door, what did I see?  
        A part of me I didn’t think was me.  

        [Chorus]  
        Wounded eyes, what did I find?  
        A world unknown, twisting my mind.  
        Curiosity, a dangerous game,  
        A click away from something I can't name.  

        [Outro]  
        Wounded eyes, can’t turn away,  
        A new desire, I can’t betray.  
        Curiosity, now my friend,  
        Will I keep searching, or will it end?  
        </pre>
